# ## Exercise 7: Data Cleaning (20 points)
#
# Load the survey data and:
# 1. Check for missing values in each column
# 2. Fill missing satisfaction_score with the median
# 3. Fill missing age_group with "Not specified"
# 4. Remove rows where would_recommend is missing
# 5. Show the before and after counts

# %%
# Load survey data

# - Return a formatted summary as a string
# - Handle errors gracefully

# %%
def generate_sales_summary(df):
    """

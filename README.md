## ðŸ““ Understanding the Notebooks

In the `notebooks/` folder, you'll find two types of files:

- **`notebooks/xxx.ipynb`** - These notebooks contain code similar to what's shown in the training slides. Use these as reference materials and for following along during the presentation.
  
- **`notebooks/xxx_demo.ipynb`** - These notebooks contain the actual code written live during the class sessions. They include real-time examples, demonstrations, and any additional explanations or variations explored during the training.

Both sets of notebooks cover the same topics but may differ slightly in approach and detail based on the interactive nature of the live sessions.
